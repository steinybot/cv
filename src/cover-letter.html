            <p>
                To the Hiring Team at Buildkite,
            </p>
            <p>
                I am excited to apply for the Senior Product Manager position. With over 14 years of
                experience in software development and technical leadership, I’ve led teams in building complex systems
                across many industries. My work with CI/CD pipelines, cloud platforms, and developer tools aligns
                closely with Buildkite’s mission to empower developers globally, and I’m eager join you on this
                endeavour.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my key experiences was setting up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, where I managed the
                promotion of artifacts and services from preview to production. This hands-on role sharpened my
                understanding of scaling CI/CD systems to support fast-paced, iterative development. At Geneious, I led
                the development of a distributed Reactive System that handled vast datasets with a focus on reliability
                and scalability.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a Team Lead, I ran planning sessions and retrospectives, coordinated with the
                Product Manager, created definitions of ready/done, helped break down tickets, configured
                the JIRA project and workflows, and communicated to other stakeholders. My ability to break down
                technical challenges into clear, actionable items has consistently helped align product decisions with
                both customer and business goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Goodcover, a Y Combinator alumni, I gained deep insight into what it takes to build products that
                users truly love. Participating in Y Combinator's Startup School reinforced how critical it is to
                continuously improve products in alignment with the North Star Metric and company OKRs, ensuring that
                every iteration is meaningful and impacts customer success. This product-driven mindset shapes the way I
                approach product delivery, constantly seeking feedback and improvements to ensure solutions are
                meaningful and solve real problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although I haven’t held a formal Product Manager role, I’ve always had a natural talent for
                understanding users’ true needs and coming up with innovative yet simple solutions. My wife, a
                non-technical Lead Product Manager, often consults me to explain technical concepts and even seeks my
                advice on product-related decisions. She often tells me I would make an excellent Product Manager, so I
                am taking her advice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to exploring how my skills and experience can
                help make software teams happier and more productive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yours sincerely,<br>
                Jason Pickens
